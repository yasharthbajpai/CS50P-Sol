# CS50P Problem Set Solutions (2022)

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets for CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python course offered by Harvard University in 2022.

## Course Overview

CS50P is an introduction to programming using Python. The course covers 9 weeks of material, each with its own problem set. You can find the official problem set descriptions [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/).

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into 9 folders, each corresponding to a week's problem set:

- Week 0: Functions, Variables
- Week 1: Conditionals
- Week 2: Loops
- Week 3: Exceptions
- Week 4: Libraries
- Week 5: Unit Tests
- Week 6: File I/O
- Week 7: Regular Expressions
- Week 8: Object-Oriented Programming

Each folder contains Python scripts that solve the problems presented in that week's problem set.

## My Journey

Over the course of 9 weeks, I've worked diligently to complete each problem set, applying the concepts learned in the lectures and short videos. This journey has significantly improved my Python programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of computer science fundamentals.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are meant to showcase my learning process and coding style. They are not intended for direct submission by other students taking the course. Please adhere to Harvard's academic honesty policy.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank the CS50 team at Harvard for creating this excellent course and making it freely available online.
